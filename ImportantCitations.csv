"Extension of this method used for ""energy independent"" calculations (scf.py)",2002,"Damle, Prashant; Ghosh, Avik W.; Datta, Supriyo",First-principles analysis of molecular conduction using quantum chemistry software,Chemical Physics,0301-0104,10.1016/S0301-0104(02)00496-2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301010402004962,"We present a rigorous and computationally efficient method to do a parameter-free analysis of molecular wires connected to contacts. The self-consistent field approach is coupled with Non-equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism to describe electronic transport under an applied bias. Standard quantum chemistry software is used to calculate the self-consistent field using density functional theory (DFT). Such close coupling to standard quantum chemistry software not only makes the procedure simple to implement but also makes the relation between the I–V characteristics and the chemistry of the molecule more obvious. We use our method to interpolate between two extreme examples of transport through a molecular wire connected to gold(111) contacts: band conduction in a metallic (gold) nanowire, and resonant conduction through broadened, quasidiscrete levels of a phenyl dithiol molecule. We obtain several quantities of interest like I–V characteristics, electron density and voltage drop along the molecule.",8/1/2002,171-187,2,281
The method used for calculating spin-dependent transmission,2020,"Zöllner, Martin Sebastian; Varela, Solmar; Medina, Ernesto; Mujica, Vladimiro; Herrmann, Carmen",Insight into the Origin of Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity from a Symmetry Analysis of Electronic Transmission,Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,15499626,10.1021/acs.jctc.9b01078,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b01078,"The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, which describes the spin-filtering ability of diamagnetic structures like DNA or peptides having chiral symmetry, has emerged in the past years as the central mechanism behind a number of important phenomena, like long-range biological electron transfer, enantiospecific electrocatalysis, and molecular recognition. Also, CISS-induced spin polarization has a considerable promise for new spintronic devices and the design of quantum materials. The CISS effect is attributed to spin-orbit coupling, but a sound theoretical understanding of the surprising magnitude of this effect in molecules without heavy atoms is currently lacking. We are taking an essential step into this direction by analyzing the importance of imaginary terms in the Hamiltonian as a necessary condition for nonvanishing spin polarization in helical structures. On the basis of first-principles calculations and analytical considerations, we perform a symmetry analysis of the key quantities determining transport probabilities of electrons of different spin orientations. These imaginary terms originate from the spin-orbit coupling, and they preserve the Hermitian nature of the Hamiltonian. Hence, they are not related to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry resulting from the fact that molecules are open systems in a junction. Our symmetry analysis helps to identify essential constraints in the theoretical description of the CISS effect. We further draw an analogy with the appearance of imaginary terms in simple models of barrier scattering, which may help understanding the unusually effective long-range electron transfer in biological systems.",5/12/2020,2914-2929,5,16
Pulay method used for convergence (original paper),1980,"Pulay, Péter",Convergence acceleration of iterative sequences. the case of scf iteration,Chemical Physics Letters,0009-2614,10.1016/0009-2614(80)80396-4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0009261480803964,"Based on a recent method of Pople et al for the solution of large systems of linear equations, a procedure is given for accelerating the convergence of slowly converging quasi-Newton— Raphson type algorithms. This procedure is particularly advantageous if the number of parameters is so large that the calculation and storage of the hessian is no longer practical. Application to the SCF problem is treated in detail.",7/15/1980,393-398,2,73

Implementation of Bethe Lattice used (from ANT.Gaussian),2011,"Jacob, D.; Palacios, J. J.",Critical comparison of electrode models in density functional theory based quantum transport calculations,The Journal of Chemical Physics,0021-9606,10.1063/1.3526044,https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3526044,"We study the performance of two different electrode models in quantum transport calculations based on density functional theory: parametrized Bethe lattices and quasi-one-dimensional wires or nanowires. A detailed account of implementation details in both the cases is given. From the systematic study of nanocontacts made of representative metallic elements, we can conclude that the parametrized electrode models represent an excellent compromise between computational cost and electronic structure definition as long as the aim is to compare with experiments where the precise atomic structure of the electrodes is not relevant or defined with precision. The results obtained using parametrized Bethe lattices are essentially similar to the ones obtained with quasi-one-dimensional electrodes for large enough cross-sections of these, adding a natural smearing to the transmission curves that mimics the true nature of polycrystalline electrodes. The latter are more demanding from the computational point of view, but present the advantage of expanding the range of applicability of transport calculations to situations where the electrodes have a well-defined atomic structure, as is the case for carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoribbons, or semiconducting nanowires. All the analysis is done with the help of codes developed by the authors which can be found in the quantum transport toolbox ALACANT and are publicly available.",1/27/2011,44118,4,134
Method of calculating spin-orbit coupling used (generalized open shell),2006,"Fernández-Seivane, L; Oliveira, M A; Sanvito, S; Ferrer, J",On-site approximation for spin–orbit coupling in linear combination of atomic orbitals density functional methods,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,"0953-8984, 1361-648X",10.1088/0953-8984/18/34/012,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/18/34/012,"We propose a computational method that drastically simpliﬁes the inclusion of the spin–orbit interaction in density functional theory when implemented over localized basis sets. Our method is based on a well-known procedure for obtaining pseudopotentials from atomic relativistic ab initio calculations and on an on-site approximation for the spin–orbit matrix elements. We have implemented the technique in the SIESTA (Soler J M et al 2002 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 14 2745–79) code, and show that it provides accurate results for the overall band-structure and splittings of group IV and III–IV semiconductors as well as for 5d metals.",8/30/2006,7999-8013,34,18
