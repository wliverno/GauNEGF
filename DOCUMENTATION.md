# GaussianNEGF

A Python package for performing Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) calculations integrated with Gaussian quantum chemistry software.

## Overview

GaussianNEGF is a powerful tool that combines density functional theory (DFT) calculations from Gaussian with NEGF formalism to simulate quantum transport in molecular devices. The package enables calculations of electronic properties and transport characteristics of molecular junctions under bias voltage.

This package builds upon the foundation laid by the open-source ANT.Gaussian package. Specifically, the Bethe lattice implementation is adapted from ANT.Gaussian's Fortran implementation, and the numerical quadrature methods for integration are also derived from ANT.Gaussian. We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of the ANT.Gaussian developers to the field of molecular electronics.

## Usage

### Basic NEGF Calculation

```python
from scf import NEGF

# Initialize NEGF calculation
negf = NEGF("molecule", basis="lanl2dz", func="b3pw91")

# Set contacts
negf.setContacts(lContact=[1], rContact=[2])

# Set voltage bias
negf.setVoltage(qV=1.0)  # 1.0V bias

# Run SCF calculation
negf.SCF(conv=1e-5, maxcycles=100)
```

### Surface Green's Function Setup

```python
from surfGBethe import surfGB

# Initialize surface Green's function
surf = surfGB(F, S, contacts, bar, latFile='Au')

# Calculate self-energy
sigma = surf.sigma(E)
```

## Key Parameters

### NEGF Class
- `basis`: Gaussian basis set (default: "lanl2dz")
- `func`: DFT functional (default: "b3pw91")
- `spin`: Spin configuration ("r" for restricted, "u" for unrestricted)
- `fullSCF`: Whether to run full SCF or use Harris approximation

### surfGB Class
- `latFile`: Metal contact parameter file (e.g., 'Au.bethe')
- `spin`: Spin configuration
- `eta`: Broadening parameter
- `T`: Temperature in Kelvin

## Integration with Gaussian

The package uses the gau-open interface to interact with Gaussian:

1. Reads Gaussian input files (.gjf)
2. Manages checkpoint files (.chk)
3. Extracts Fock and overlap matrices
4. Updates density matrices
5. Handles basis set information

## File Formats

### Bethe Lattice Parameters (.bethe)
Contains Slater-Koster parameters for metal contacts:
- Onsite energies (es, ep, edd, edt)
- Hopping integrals (sss, sps, pps, etc.)
- Overlap parameters (Ssss, Ssps, etc.)

### Gaussian Files
- `.gjf`: Input geometry and calculation parameters
- `.chk`: Checkpoint file for matrices and wavefunctions
- `.log`: Output file with calculation results

## Best Practices

1. Always check SCF convergence carefully
2. Use appropriate basis sets for both molecule and contacts
3. Ensure proper contact atom selection
4. Monitor electron count throughout calculations
5. Verify energy conservation in transport calculations

## Error Handling

The package includes various error checks:
- Matrix dimension consistency
- Electron count verification
- Convergence monitoring
- Contact setup validation

## Performance Tips

1. Use Pulay mixing for faster convergence
2. Optimize integration parameters for accuracy vs. speed
3. Choose appropriate convergence criteria
4. Monitor memory usage for large systems

## Known Limitations

1. Currently supports up to two terminals
2. Limited to specific metal surface orientations
3. Requires Gaussian installation
4. Memory intensive for large systems
