Overview
--------

gauNEGF implements Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) calculations with Density Functional Theory (DFT) using Gaussian basis sets. The key theoretical components are:

1. **NEGF Formalism**
   - Green's functions in quantum transport
   - Self-energy and contact effects
   - Current and transmission calculations

2. **DFT Integration**
   - Density matrix construction
   - Self-consistent field iterations
   - Basis set considerations

3. **Transport Theory**
   - Landauer-BÃ¼ttiker formalism
   - Coherent transport
   - Spin-dependent transport

Getting Started
-------------

To understand the theoretical framework:

1. Start with :doc:`introduction` for basic concepts and system setup
2. Dive into :doc:`negf_dft` for detailed methodology
3. Explore :doc:`transport` for transport calculations
4. Review :doc:`best_practices` for optimal usage
